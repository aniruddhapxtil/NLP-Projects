From diagnosis to treatment planning, AI is enhancing the accuracy, speed, and efficiency of medical services. One of the most notable advancements is in the area of medical imaging. AI-powered tools can now detect anomalies in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with remarkable precision, sometimes even outperforming human radiologists. Beyond imaging, AI is also making waves in predictive analytics. By analyzing patient records, genetic data, and lifestyle information, AI models can predict the onset of diseases like diabetes, heart conditions, and even certain cancers.\n","\n","In hospitals, AI-driven robots assist in surgeries, ensuring minimal invasiveness and faster recovery times. Virtual nursing assistants provide 24/7 support to patients, answering queries and monitoring vitals through wearable technology. Moreover, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is being used to transcribe doctor-patient interactions, reducing administrative burdens and allowing doctors to focus more on patient care. AI is also playing a pivotal role in drug discovery by speeding up the identification of potential compounds and reducing the time to market.\n","\n","However, despite its benefits, the integration of AI in healthcare raises concerns around data privacy, ethical use, and the potential loss of human touch in caregiving. Ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI models is crucial. As the technology continues to evolve, a collaborative approach involving tech experts, healthcare professionals, and policymakers will be vital in harnessing the full potential of AI while safeguarding human values.\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","summary = lsa_summarizer(text, num_sentences=1)\n","print(\"Summary:\\n\", summary)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"RzN0fVNJGMbK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744481774845,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Aniruddha Patil","userId":"10327901744838075884"}},"outputId":"31a7d870-7cd1-4774-94e3-4e7b16d3f773"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Summary:\n"," However, despite its benefits, the integration of AI in healthcare raises concerns around data privacy, ethical use, and the potential loss of human touch in caregiving.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","\n","# Download essential NLTK resources\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0hR6ZtMwF9d9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744479708574,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Aniruddha Patil","userId":"10327901744838075884"}},"outputId":"4b0481a7-7fcc-4a39-e7d8-3bad995d3630"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package averaged_perceptron_tagger to\n","[nltk_data]     /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package averaged_perceptron_tagger is already up-to-\n","[nltk_data]       date!\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]}]}
